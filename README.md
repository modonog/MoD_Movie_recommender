This is for a CS8740 project, a movie recommendation system. 
The system uses the Final_movie_dataset.csv and the precomputed similarities between movies
stored in top_similar_movies.pkl
The GUI then uses these along with data from the csv to show, user ratings of the movie,
the poster images that are used by IMDB and links to the IMDB webpage.
